Key Projects
RAG API for Curriculum Analysis ( Desafio Técnico - TheGarage )
Developed an intelligent backend using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and LangChain. The system parses curricula (PDF/image), performs OCR (EasyOCR, Whisper), and applies Gemini-based RAG pipelines for answering business queries. Modular and optimized for reliability and traceability via LangSmith.
OCR + LLM API for Intelligent Resume Analysis
Production-ready RESTful API built with FastAPI, PaddleOCR, and Hugging Face Transformers for automated resume extraction and interpretation. Supports PDF/image OCR, LLM-based summarization and Q&A, and logs requests in MongoDB for traceability. Fully containerized with Docker and deployable via Docker Compose. Emphasizes modular architecture, environment-based configuration, and structured logging.
Tech Stack: FastAPI · Python · PaddleOCR · Hugging Face Transformers · PyMongo · MongoDB · Docker · Docker Compose · RESTful API Design
Jira Automation Platform
Built a real-time backend pipeline that extracts Jira issue data and streams insights to Grafana. Used FastAPI with async tasks and PostgreSQL. Integrated OpenAI Whisper for audio transcription workflows.
Sai App
Architected the microservice backend of an AI-powered productivity app. Focused on clean DDD patterns, asynchronous operations, and secure API boundaries.
DevRequest
Engineered backend for AI-based candidate matching platform. Applied GPT for intelligent candidate scoring. Stack: Python, MongoDB, FastAPI.
Mia - AI Assistant
Developed backend infrastructure for context-aware empathetic assistant. Emphasis on vector-based memory and LLM personalization.
